Hindi Corpus

The corpus was made with the help of an online tool: https://app.sketchengine.eu/.
This tool helps in compiling a corpus by scraping the given URLs, removing the stop words followed by tokenization.

The program filter.py was used to filter the csv file.

Some common Hindi websites were identified and then links were scraped out of them.
The program extract.py was used to fetch links from the source URLs.
